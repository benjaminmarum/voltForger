# React Canvas Game Overview

This notebook provides an overview of a game implemented using React and the react-canvas library. The game involves various game objects such as IronOre, IronMine, GoldOre, GoldMine, City, and Transporter, which are represented on a 2D map. The game objects have their own properties and behaviors, and they interact with each other in various ways.

## Current Functionality

1. **Game Map Generation**: The game generates a 2D map filled with game objects. The map generation is random, with each tile possibly containing an instance of IronOre, IronMine, GoldOre, GoldMine, City, or Transporter.

2. **Resource Collection**: Cities in the game can collect resources from nearby mines. The amount of resources collected depends on the rate of the mine.

3. **Resource Transportation**: Transporters in the game can transport resources from mines to cities within their range.

4. **Game Object Rendering**: Each game object can be rendered on the canvas. The rendering takes into account the camera position, allowing for scrolling of the game map.

5. **Game State Update**: The game state is updated in each frame, with cities collecting resources and transporters transporting resources.

## Technology Used

The game is implemented using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components, which can manage their own state and render themselves.

The game also uses the react-canvas library, which provides a set of React components for working with the HTML5 Canvas API. This allows for efficient rendering of the game objects on the canvas.

The game logic is implemented in plain JavaScript. The game objects are represented as classes, which encapsulate their properties and behaviors. The game state is managed in a GameState class, which handles the generation of the game map, the updating of the game state, and the rendering of the game objects.

## Game Object Class

The GameObject class is the base class for all game objects. It defines the common properties and methods for all game objects.

### Properties

- **x**: The x-coordinate of the game object on the game map.
- **y**: The y-coordinate of the game object on the game map.
- **sprite**: The sprite image used to represent the game object on the canvas.

### Methods

- **draw(ctx, cameraX, cameraY)**: This method is used to draw the game object on the canvas. It takes the canvas context and the camera position as parameters. The camera position is used to adjust the position of the game object on the canvas based on the current view of the game map.

Here is the JavaScript code for the GameObject class:

```javascript
class GameObject {
  constructor(x, y, sprite) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.sprite = sprite;
  }

  draw(ctx, cameraX, cameraY) {
    const { x, y, sprite } = this;
    ctx.drawImage(sprite, (x - cameraX) * tileSize, (y - cameraY) * tileSize);
  }
}
```

In the `draw` method, the position of the game object is adjusted based on the camera position before drawing the sprite on the canvas. This allows for scrolling of the game map.

## Resource Class

The Resource class is a subclass of GameObject. It represents resources in the game, such as iron ore and gold ore.

### Properties

- **x**: The x-coordinate of the resource on the game map. Inherited from GameObject.
- **y**: The y-coordinate of the resource on the game map. Inherited from GameObject.
- **sprite**: The sprite image used to represent the resource on the canvas. Inherited from GameObject.
- **amount**: The amount of resource available.

### Methods

- **draw(ctx, cameraX, cameraY)**: This method is used to draw the resource on the canvas. It takes the canvas context and the camera position as parameters. The camera position is used to adjust the position of the resource on the canvas based on the current view of the game map. Inherited from GameObject.

Here is the JavaScript code for the Resource class:

```javascript
class Resource extends GameObject {
  constructor(x, y, sprite, amount) {
    super(x, y, sprite);
    this.amount = amount;
  }
}
```

The Resource class extends the GameObject class, inheriting its properties and methods. It adds an additional `amount` property to represent the amount of resource available. The `draw` method is inherited from the GameObject class and does not need to be redefined in the Resource class.

## IronOre and GoldOre Classes

The IronOre and GoldOre classes are subclasses of Resource. They represent iron ore and gold ore resources in the game.

### Properties

- **x**: The x-coordinate of the resource on the game map. Inherited from Resource.
- **y**: The y-coordinate of the resource on the game map. Inherited from Resource.
- **sprite**: The sprite image used to represent the resource on the canvas. Inherited from Resource.
- **amount**: The amount of resource available. Inherited from Resource.

### Methods

- **draw(ctx, cameraX, cameraY)**: This method is used to draw the resource on the canvas. It takes the canvas context and the camera position as parameters. The camera position is used to adjust the position of the resource on the canvas based on the current view of the game map. Inherited from Resource.

Here is the JavaScript code for the IronOre and GoldOre classes:

```javascript
class IronOre extends Resource {
  constructor(x, y, sprite) {
    super(x, y, sprite, 10000);
  }
}

class GoldOre extends Resource {
  constructor(x, y, sprite) {
    super(x, y, sprite, 10000);
  }
}
```

The IronOre and GoldOre classes extend the Resource class, inheriting its properties and methods. They do not add any new properties or methods. The `draw` method is inherited from the Resource class and does not need to be redefined in these classes. The amount of resource available is set to 100 in the constructors of these classes.

## Mine Class

The Mine class is a subclass of GameObject. It represents mines in the game, such as iron mines and gold mines.

### Properties

- **x**: The x-coordinate of the mine on the game map. Inherited from GameObject.
- **y**: The y-coordinate of the mine on the game map. Inherited from GameObject.
- **sprite**: The sprite image used to represent the mine on the canvas. Inherited from GameObject.
- **rate**: The rate at which the mine produces resources.

### Methods

- **draw(ctx, cameraX, cameraY)**: This method is used to draw the mine on the canvas. It takes the canvas context and the camera position as parameters. The camera position is used to adjust the position of the mine on the canvas based on the current view of the game map. Inherited from GameObject.

Here is the JavaScript code for the Mine class:

```javascript
class Mine extends GameObject {
  constructor(x, y, sprite, rate) {
    super(x, y, sprite);
    this.rate = rate;
  }
}
```

The Mine class extends the GameObject class, inheriting its properties and methods. It adds an additional `rate` property to represent the rate at which the mine produces resources. The `draw` method is inherited from the GameObject class and does not need to be redefined in the Mine class.

## IronMine and GoldMine Classes

The IronMine and GoldMine classes are subclasses of Mine. They represent iron mines and gold mines in the game.

### Properties

- **x**: The x-coordinate of the mine on the game map. Inherited from Mine.
- **y**: The y-coordinate of the mine on the game map. Inherited from Mine.
- **sprite**: The sprite image used to represent the mine on the canvas. Inherited from Mine.
- **rate**: The rate at which the mine produces resources. Inherited from Mine.

### Methods

- **draw(ctx, cameraX, cameraY)**: This method is used to draw the mine on the canvas. It takes the canvas context and the camera position as parameters. The camera position is used to adjust the position of the mine on the canvas based on the current view of the game map. Inherited from Mine.

Here is the JavaScript code for the IronMine and GoldMine classes:

```javascript
class IronMine extends Mine {
  constructor(x, y, sprite) {
    super(x, y, sprite, 1);
  }
}

class GoldMine extends Mine {
  constructor(x, y, sprite) {
    super(x, y, sprite, 0.5);
  }
}
```

The IronMine and GoldMine classes extend the Mine class, inheriting its properties and methods. They do not add any new properties or methods. The `draw` method is inherited from the Mine class and does not need to be redefined in these classes. The rate of resource production is set to 1 for iron mines and 0.5 for gold mines in the constructors of these classes.

## JavaScript Testing

Testing is an important part of software development. It helps ensure that your code works as expected and can help prevent future bugs. In JavaScript, there are several testing frameworks available, such as Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine.

Here is an example of how you might write tests for the GameObject, Resource, Mine, IronOre, GoldOre, IronMine, and GoldMine classes using Jest:

```javascript
const { GameObject, Resource, Mine, IronOre, GoldOre, IronMine, GoldMine } = require('./gameObjects');

describe('GameObject', () => {
  test('should correctly instantiate a game object', () => {
    const gameObject = new GameObject(1, 2, 'sprite.png');
    expect(gameObject.x).toBe(1);
    expect(gameObject.y).toBe(2);
    expect(gameObject.sprite).toBe('sprite.png');
  });
});

describe('Resource', () => {
  test('should correctly instantiate a resource', () => {
    const resource = new Resource(1, 2, 'sprite.png', 100);
    expect(resource.x).toBe(1);
    expect(resource.y).toBe(2);
    expect(resource.sprite).toBe('sprite.png');
    expect(resource.amount).toBe(100);
  });
});

describe('Mine', () => {
  test('should correctly instantiate a mine', () => {
    const mine = new Mine(1, 2, 'sprite.png', 1);
    expect(mine.x).toBe(1);
    expect(mine.y).toBe(2);
    expect(mine.sprite).toBe('sprite.png');
    expect(mine.rate).toBe(1);
  });
});

describe('IronOre', () => {
  test('should correctly instantiate iron ore', () => {
    const ironOre = new IronOre(1, 2, 'sprite.png');
    expect(ironOre.x).toBe(1);
    expect(ironOre.y).toBe(2);
    expect(ironOre.sprite).toBe('sprite.png');
    expect(ironOre.amount).toBe(100);
  });
});

describe('GoldOre', () => {
  test('should correctly instantiate gold ore', () => {
    const goldOre = new GoldOre(1, 2, 'sprite.png');
    expect(goldOre.x).toBe(1);
    expect(goldOre.y).toBe(2);
    expect(goldOre.sprite).toBe('sprite.png');
    expect(goldOre.amount).toBe(100);
  });
});

describe('IronMine', () => {
  test('should correctly instantiate an iron mine', () => {
    const ironMine = new IronMine(1, 2, 'sprite.png');
    expect(ironMine.x).toBe(1);
    expect(ironMine.y).toBe(2);
    expect(ironMine.sprite).toBe('sprite.png');
    expect(ironMine.rate).toBe(1);
  });
});

describe('GoldMine', () => {
  test('should correctly instantiate a gold mine', () => {
    const goldMine = new GoldMine(1, 2, 'sprite.png');
    expect(goldMine.x).toBe(1);
    expect(goldMine.y).toBe(2);
    expect(goldMine.sprite).toBe('sprite.png');
    expect(goldMine.rate).toBe(0.5);
  });
});
```

These tests check that the constructors for each class correctly initialize the properties of the objects. You can run these tests using the `jest` command in your terminal.

## City Class

The `City` class extends the `GameObject` class and represents a city in the game. It has additional properties such as `resources` and `storage` which represent the resources that the city has and the maximum amount of resources that the city can store, respectively. The `City` class also has a method `collectResources` which allows the city to collect resources from nearby mines.

## Transporter Class

The `Transporter` class extends the `GameObject` class and represents a transporter in the game. It has additional properties such as `level` and `range` which represent the level of the transporter and the range of the transporter, respectively. The `Transporter` class also has a method `transportResources` which allows the transporter to transport resources from mines to cities.

## GameState Class

The `GameState` class represents the state of the game. It has properties such as `atlasArray` which is a 2D array to store the game objects, and `cameraX` and `cameraY` which determine the position of the camera in the game world. The `GameState` class has methods such as `generateMap` to generate a random map of game objects, `draw` to draw the game state on the canvas, and `update` to update the game state.

## Game Component

The `Game` component is a functional component that represents the game. It uses a ref to get a reference to the canvas DOM element and a state to store the game state in the component's state. It sets up the game loop when the component mounts and stops the game loop when the component unmounts. The `Game` component also handles the canvas click event to place a mine or a city at the clicked tile.

```javascript
class City extends GameObject { // City is a type of GameObject
  constructor(x, y, sprite) {
    super(x, y, sprite); // Call the constructor of the GameObject class
    this.resources = { // Resources that the city has
      iron: 0,
      gold: 0
    };
    this.storage = { // Maximum amount of resources that the city can store
      iron: 100,
      gold: 100
    };
  }

  // Method to collect resources from nearby mines
  collectResources(gameState) {
    // Loop over all the game objects
    for (const object of gameState.atlasArray.flat()) {
      // If the object is an IronMine or GoldMine and it's close to the city
      if ((object instanceof IronMine || object instanceof GoldMine) && Math.abs(object.x - this.x) <= 1 && Math.abs(object.y - this.y) <= 1) {
        // Increase the city's corresponding resources
        const resource = object instanceof IronMine ? 'iron' : 'gold';
        this.resources[resource] = Math.min(this.resources[resource] + object.rate, this.storage[resource]);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `City` class extends the `GameObject` class and represents a city in the game. It has additional properties such as `resources` and `storage` which represent the resources that the city has and the maximum amount of resources that the city can store, respectively. The `City` class also has a method `collectResources` which allows the city to collect resources from nearby mines.

The `collectResources` method loops over all the game objects and checks if the object is an `IronMine` or `GoldMine` and it's close to the city. If it is, it increases the city's corresponding resources by the rate of the mine, but not exceeding the city's storage capacity for that resource.

```javascript
class Transporter extends GameObject { // Transporter is a type of GameObject
  constructor(x, y, sprite) {
    super(x, y, sprite); // Call the constructor of the GameObject class
    this.level = 1; // Level of the transporter
    this.range = 1; // Range of the transporter
  }

  // Method to transport resources from mines to cities
  transportResources(gameState) {
    // Loop over all the game objects
    for (const object of gameState.atlasArray.flat()) {
      // If the object is an IronMine or GoldMine and it's within the transporter's range
      if ((object instanceof IronMine || object instanceof GoldMine) && Math.abs(object.x - this.x) <= this.range && Math.abs(object.y - this.y) <= this.range) {
        // Transport the resources to the city
        const city = gameState.atlasArray.flat().find(obj => obj instanceof City);
        if (city) {
          const resource = object instanceof IronMine ? 'iron' : 'gold';
          city.resources[resource] = Math.min(city.resources[resource] + object.rate, city.storage[resource]);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `Transporter` class extends the `GameObject` class and represents a transporter in the game. It has additional properties such as `level` and `range` which represent the level of the transporter and the range of the transporter, respectively. The `Transporter` class also has a method `transportResources` which allows the transporter to transport resources from mines to cities.

The `transportResources` method loops over all the game objects and checks if the object is an `IronMine` or `GoldMine` and it's within the transporter's range. If it is, it transports the resources to the city by increasing the city's corresponding resources by the rate of the mine, but not exceeding the city's storage capacity for that resource.

```javascript
class GameState {
  constructor() {
    // 2D array to store the game objects
    // Each element of the array is a game object
    this.atlasArray = [];

    // Camera coordinates
    // These determine the position of the camera in the game world
    this.cameraX = 0;
    this.cameraY = 0;
  }

  // Method to generate a random map of game objects
  generateMap(width, height) {
    // Create a 2D array of the specified width and height
    this.atlasArray = Array.from({ length: height }, () => Array.from({ length: width }, () => null));

    // Populate the array with game objects
    for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
      for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
        // Randomly choose a type of game object
        const rand = Math.random();
        if (rand < 0.1) {
          this.atlasArray[y][x] = new IronOre(x, y, sprites.ironOre);
        } else if (rand < 0.2) {
          this.atlasArray[y][x] = new IronMine(x, y, sprites.ironMine);
        } else if (rand < 0.3) {
          this.atlasArray[y][x] = new GoldOre(x, y, sprites.goldOre);
        } else if (rand < 0.4) {
          this.atlasArray[y][x] = new GoldMine(x, y, sprites.goldMine);
        } else if (rand < 0.5) {
          this.atlasArray[y][x] = new City(x, y, sprites.city);
        } else if (rand < 0.6) {
          this.atlasArray[y][x] = new Transporter(x, y, sprites.transporter);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Method to draw the game state on the canvas
  draw(ctx) {
    // Clear the canvas
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, ctx.canvas.width, ctx.canvas.height);

    // Draw all the game objects
    for (const object of this.atlasArray.flat()) {
      if (object) {
        object.draw(ctx, this.cameraX, this.cameraY);
      }
    }
  }

  // Method to update the game state
  update() {
    // Collect resources for all the cities
    for (const object of this.atlasArray.flat()) {
      if (object instanceof City) {
        object.collectResources(this);
      }
    }

    // Transport resources for all the transporters
    for (const object of this.atlasArray.flat()) {
      if (object instanceof Transporter) {
        object.transportResources(this);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `GameState` class represents the state of the game. It has properties such as `atlasArray` which is a 2D array to store the game objects, and `cameraX` and `cameraY` which determine the position of the camera in the game world.

The `GameState` class has several methods:

- `generateMap(width, height)`: This method generates a random map of game objects. It creates a 2D array of the specified width and height and populates the array with game objects.
- `draw(ctx)`: This method draws the game state on the canvas. It clears the canvas and then draws all the game objects.
- `update()`: This method updates the game state. It collects resources for all the cities and transports resources for all the transporters.

```javascript
// Define the tileSize
const tileSize = 32;

// Create a new GameState
const gameState = new GameState();
gameState.generateMap(100, 100);

// Define the Game component
// This is a functional component that represents the game
function Game() {
  // Create a ref for the canvas
  // This allows us to get a reference to the canvas DOM element
  const canvasRef = useRef(null);

  // Create a state for the game state
  // This allows us to store the game state in the component's state
  const [gameState, setGameState] = useState(new GameState());

  // Use an effect hook to set up the game loop when the component mounts
  useEffect(() => {
    // Generate a map
    gameState.generateMap(100, 100);

    // Set up the game loop
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      // Update the game state
      gameState.update();

      // Draw the game state
      const ctx = canvasRef.current.getContext('2d');
      gameState.draw(ctx);
    }, 1000 / 60); // 60 FPS

    // Return a cleanup function that stops the game loop when the component unmounts
    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []);

  // Handle the canvas click event
  const handleCanvasClick = (event) => {
    // Get the canvas bounding rect
    const rect = canvasRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();

    // Calculate the clicked tile coordinates
    const tileX = Math.floor((event.clientX - rect.left + gameState.cameraX) / tileSize);
    const tileY = Math.floor((event.clientY - rect.top + gameState.cameraY) / tileSize);

    // If the user is placing a mine, place a mine at the clicked tile
    if (gameState.placingMine) {
      gameState.atlasArray[tileY][tileX] = new IronMine(tileX, tileY, sprites.ironMine);
      setGameState({ ...gameState, placingMine: false });
    }

    // If the user is placing a city, place a city at the clicked tile
    if (gameState.placingCity) {
      gameState.atlasArray[tileY][tileX] = new City(tileX, tileY, sprites.city);
      setGameState({ ...gameState, placingCity: false });
    }
  }

  // Render the game
  return (
    <div>
      <canvas ref={canvasRef} onClick={handleCanvasClick} />
      <button onClick={handlePlaceMine}>Place Mine</button>
      <button onClick={handlePlaceCity}>Place City</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Game;
```

The `Game` component is a functional component that represents the game. It uses React's `useRef` hook to create a reference to the canvas DOM element, and the `useState` hook to store the game state in the component's state.

The `useEffect` hook is used to set up the game loop when the component mounts. It generates a map, sets up the game loop, updates the game state, and draws the game state. The game loop runs at 60 FPS.

The `handleCanvasClick` function is used to handle the canvas click event. It calculates the clicked tile coordinates and places a mine or a city at the clicked tile if the user is placing a mine or a city, respectively.

The `Game` component returns a `div` element that contains the canvas and two buttons for placing a mine and a city. The `Game` component is exported as the default export.

## JavaScript Tests for the Game Project Code

Now that we have our game project code, it's important to ensure that our code is working as expected. To do this, we can write tests for our code. In JavaScript, there are several testing libraries and frameworks we can use, such as Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, etc. For this project, we will use Jest, a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

Here are some tests that we can write for our game project code:

1. **GameObject Class Tests:**
   - Test that a GameObject can be created with the correct properties.
   - Test that the `draw` method correctly draws the GameObject on the canvas.

2. **IronOre, IronMine, GoldOre, GoldMine, City, Transporter Class Tests:**
   - Test that an instance of each class can be created with the correct properties.
   - Test that the `draw` method correctly draws the instance on the canvas.
   - For City and Transporter, test that the `collectResources` and `transportResources` methods respectively work as expected.

3. **GameState Class Tests:**
   - Test that a GameState can be created with the correct properties.
   - Test that the `generateMap` method correctly generates a map of game objects.
   - Test that the `draw` method correctly draws the game state on the canvas.
   - Test that the `update` method correctly updates the game state.

4. **Game Component Tests:**
   - Test that the Game component renders correctly.
   - Test that the game loop is set up correctly in the `useEffect` hook.
   - Test that the `handleCanvasClick` method correctly places a mine or city at the clicked tile.

Please note that these tests require a testing environment that can handle the canvas API and React components, which is beyond the scope of this notebook. However, you can set up such an environment in your local development setup and write the tests there.

Here is an example of how you can write a test for the GameObject class using Jest:

```javascript
const { GameObject } = require('./game'); // adjust the path according to your setup

describe('GameObject', () => {
  test('should be created with correct properties', () => {
    const gameObject = new GameObject(1, 2, 'sprite.png');

    expect(gameObject.x).toBe(1);
    expect(gameObject.y).toBe(2);
    expect(gameObject.sprite).toBe('sprite.png');
  });

  // ... other tests ...
});
```

This test creates a new GameObject and checks that its properties are set correctly. You can write similar tests for the other classes and methods in your code.

## In-Depth Summary of the Application Logic

The game project code is a simple simulation game where resources are collected and transported. The game is built using JavaScript and utilizes the canvas API for rendering. The game logic is divided into several classes, each representing a different type of game object or a state of the game. Here is a detailed walkthrough of the application logic:

1. **GameObject Class (Cell [11])**: This is the base class for all game objects. It contains properties for the x and y coordinates and the sprite of the game object. The `draw` method is used to draw the game object on the canvas.

2. **IronOre, IronMine, GoldOre, GoldMine Classes (Cell [12])**: These classes represent different types of resources in the game. They extend the GameObject class and add additional properties specific to each type of resource.

3. **City Class (Cell [13])**: This class represents a city in the game. It extends the GameObject class and adds properties for the resources and storage of the city. The `collectResources` method is used to collect resources from nearby mines.

4. **Transporter Class (Cell [14])**: This class represents a transporter in the game. It extends the GameObject class and adds properties for the level and range of the transporter. The `transportResources` method is used to transport resources from mines to cities.

5. **GameState Class (Cell [15])**: This class represents the state of the game. It contains a 2D array of game objects and properties for the camera coordinates. The `generateMap` method is used to generate a random map of game objects. The `draw` method is used to draw the game state on the canvas. The `update` method is used to update the game state, which involves collecting resources for all cities and transporting resources for all transporters.

6. **Game Component (Cell [16])**: This is a React functional component that represents the game. It uses a ref to get a reference to the canvas DOM element and a state to store the game state. It sets up the game loop in an effect hook, which updates and draws the game state at a rate of 60 FPS. It also handles the canvas click event, which places a mine or city at the clicked tile depending on the current state.

The game starts by creating a new GameState and generating a map. Then, it enters the game loop, where it continuously updates and draws the game state. The user can interact with the game by clicking on the canvas to place mines or cities.

The game project code demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. It uses classes to represent different types of game objects and encapsulate their behavior. It also uses inheritance to create subclasses for different types of game objects. The game state is managed in a single GameState class, which makes it easy to update and draw the game state. The game logic is separated from the rendering logic, which is handled by the Game component. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

The `draw` method is used to draw the game object on the canvas. This class serves as the foundation for all other game objects, providing common properties and methods that all game objects will have.

2. **IronOre, IronMine, GoldOre, GoldMine Classes (Cell [12])**: These classes represent different types of resources in the game. They extend the GameObject class and add additional properties specific to each type of resource. These classes represent the different types of resources that can be collected in the game. Each class has a `draw` method that draws the resource on the canvas.

3. **City Class (Cell [13])**: This class represents a city in the game. It extends the GameObject class and adds properties for the resources and storage of the city. The `collectResources` method is used to collect resources from nearby mines. This class represents a city that can collect resources from nearby mines and store them.

4. **Transporter Class (Cell [14])**: This class represents a transporter in the game. It extends the GameObject class and adds properties for the level and range of the transporter. The `transportResources` method is used to transport resources from mines to cities. This class represents a transporter that can transport resources from mines to cities.

5. **GameState Class (Cell [15])**: This class represents the state of the game. It contains a 2D array of game objects and properties for the camera coordinates. The `generateMap` method is used to generate a random map of game objects. The `draw` method is used to draw the game state on the canvas. The `update` method is used to update the game state, which involves collecting resources for all cities and transporting resources for all transporters. This class manages the overall state of the game, including the map of game objects and the game's camera coordinates.

6. **Game Component (Cell [16])**: This is a React functional component that represents the game. It uses a ref to get a reference to the canvas DOM element and a state to store the game state. It sets up the game loop in an effect hook, which updates and draws the game state at a rate of 60 FPS. It also handles the canvas click event, which places a mine or city at the clicked tile depending on the current state. This component is the main entry point of the game. It sets up the game loop and handles user interactions.

The game project code demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. It uses classes to represent different types of game objects and encapsulate their behavior. It also uses inheritance to create subclasses for different types of game objects. The game state is managed in a single GameState class, which makes it easy to update and draw the game state. The game logic is separated from the rendering logic, which is handled by the Game component. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand and maintain.


```
// Test for GameObject class
let gameObject = new GameObject(0, 0, 'sprite.png');
console.assert(gameObject.x === 0, 'GameObject x coordinate is not set correctly');
console.assert(gameObject.y === 0, 'GameObject y coordinate is not set correctly');
console.assert(gameObject.sprite === 'sprite.png', 'GameObject sprite is not set correctly');

// Test for IronOre class
let ironOre = new IronOre(0, 0);
console.assert(ironOre instanceof GameObject, 'IronOre is not an instance of GameObject');
console.assert(ironOre.value === 10, 'IronOre value is not set correctly');

// Test for IronMine class
let ironMine = new IronMine(0, 0);
console.assert(ironMine instanceof GameObject, 'IronMine is not an instance of GameObject');
console.assert(ironMine.capacity === 100, 'IronMine capacity is not set correctly');

// Test for GoldOre class
let goldOre = new GoldOre(0, 0);
console.assert(goldOre instanceof GameObject, 'GoldOre is not an instance of GameObject');
console.assert(goldOre.value === 20, 'GoldOre value is not set correctly');

// Test for GoldMine class
let goldMine = new GoldMine(0, 0);
console.assert(goldMine instanceof GameObject, 'GoldMine is not an instance of GameObject');
console.assert(goldMine.capacity === 200, 'GoldMine capacity is not set correctly');

// Test for City class
let city = new City(0, 0);
console.assert(city instanceof GameObject, 'City is not an instance of GameObject');
console.assert(city.resources.iron === 0, 'City iron resources are not initialized correctly');
console.assert(city.resources.gold === 0, 'City gold resources are not initialized correctly');

// Test for Transporter class
let transporter = new Transporter(0, 0);
console.assert(transporter instanceof GameObject, 'Transporter is not an instance of GameObject');
console.assert(transporter.level === 1, 'Transporter level is not initialized correctly');
console.assert(transporter.range === 5, 'Transporter range is not initialized correctly');

// Test for GameState class
let gameState = new GameState();
console.assert(gameState.cameraX === 0, 'GameState cameraX is not initialized correctly');
console.assert(gameState.cameraY === 0, 'GameState cameraY is not initialized correctly');
console.assert(Array.isArray(gameState.map), 'GameState map is not an array');
console.assert(gameState.map.length === 0, 'GameState map is not initialized correctly');
